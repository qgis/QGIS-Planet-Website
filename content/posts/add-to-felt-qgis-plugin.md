<p>The gift economy of Open Source is community driven and filled by folks with ideas that just go for it!</p>
<p>We at <strong>North Road</strong> are blessed that we get to join these creatives on their journey in order to get their products to you. Recently, the first <a href="https://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> flagship sponsor, <a href="https://felt.com/product">Felt</a>, engaged us to further strengthen their support for the up to <a href="https://feed.qgis.org/metabase/public/dashboard/df81071d-4c75-45b8-a698-97b8649d7228">600,000 daily QGIS users</a> to integrate their workflows between <strong>QGIS</strong> and <strong>Felt</strong>.</p>
<p>The result is the &#8220;<a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/felt/">Add to Felt&#8221;</a> QGIS Plugin, which makes it super-simple to publish your QGIS maps to the Felt platform.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-212556" height="631" src="https://north-road.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/felt_blog_image_fromQ-1024x631.jpg" width="1024" /></p>
<p>To get started, install the <strong>Add to Felt Plugin</strong> from the <strong>QGIS Plugin manager</strong>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a free <strong>Felt</strong> account, you&#8217;ll need to sign up for one <a href="https://felt.com/signup">online</a> (or from the <strong>Add to Felt</strong> plugin itself once you have installed it).</p>
<p>Within <strong>QGIS</strong>, users can easily publish their maps and layers to <strong>Felt. </strong>You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish a single layer by right-clicking the layer and selecting &#8220;Share Layer to Felt&#8221; from the Export sub-menu</li>
<li>Publish your whole QGIS project/map by selecting the Project Menu, Export, &#8220;Add to Felt&#8221; action</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst <strong>Felt</strong> is loading up your map, you can continue working and it will let you know once your map is ready to open on Felt and share with others.</p>

<p>We are happy to let you know that the collaboration does not stop there! As with our <a href="https://north-road.com/slyr/">SLYR</a> tool, there is ongoing development as the requirements of the community and technology grow.  So install the <a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/felt/">Add to Felt Plugin</a> via the <strong>QGIS Plugin manager</strong>, and let us know where you want it to go via the <a href="https://github.com/felt/qgis-plugin/issues">Add to Felt GitHub page.</a></p>
