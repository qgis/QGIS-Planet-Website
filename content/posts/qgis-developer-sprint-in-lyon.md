QGIS Developer Sprint in Lyon

&nbsp;

QGIS Server 3.0 is going to be better than ever! Last week I attended to the mini code-sprint organized by the french QGIS developers in Lyon.

&nbsp;

The code sprint was focused on QGIS Server refactoring to reach the following goals:
<ul>
 	<li>increase maintainability through modularity and clean code responsibilities</li>
 	<li>increase performances</li>
 	<li>better multi-project handling and caching</li>
 	<li>scalability</li>
 	<li>multi threaded rendering</li>
</ul>
By working for different companies on such a big Open Source project like QGIS, coordination between developers is fundamentally achieved through those kind of events.

We were a small group of engaged QGIS Server developers and I think that the alternance between brainstorming and coding has proven to be very productive: after two days we were able to set common milestones and commitments that will ensure a bright future to QGIS Server.

A huge and warm thank to the french QGIS developers that organized this meeting!
