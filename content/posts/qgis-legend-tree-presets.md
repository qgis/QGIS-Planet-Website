<p>One of the cool outcomes of our recent <a href="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/qgis-legend-refactoring/" target="_blank">QGIS Legend Refactoring</a> work was the ability to add "visibility presets". This feature allows users to save and load preset layer and group visibility settings.</p>

<h2 id="main-canvas">Main canvas</h2>
<p>First select the layers and groups, you’d like to manage visibility presets for. Now click <img src="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/img/posts/preset_icon.png" /> at the top of the Layers panel and select <strong>Add preset …</strong> A new window will appear. Enter a name for the preset and click OK. Next time you click <img src="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/img/posts/preset_icon.png" /> you should see the saved presets. The presets also save the visibility of categories in each layer.</p>

<p>In the video below, we create two presets. One for a specific site location and another zoomed to the outline of Great Britain which will be used as an overview in the print composer.</p>

<p>The print composer now allows multiple map windows, each locked to a different layer visibility preset. This means a single map composer can show map windows with different layer arrangements.</p>

<p>In the video below, one preset is used for the main map and the other for an overview:</p>
