<p><strong>What is the &#8216;Add to Felt&#8217; QGIS Plugin?</strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;Add to Felt&#8217; QGIS Plugin is a powerful tool that empowers users to export their QGIS projects and layers directly to a Felt web map. This update introduces two fantastic features:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Single Layer Sharing:</strong> You can now share a single layer from your QGIS project to a Felt map. This means you have greater control over which specific data layers to share, allowing you to tailor your map precisely to your audience&#8217;s needs.</li>
<li><strong>Map Selection:</strong> With the updated plugin, you can choose which map on Felt to add your layer to – a new map, or an ongoing project. This flexibility simplifies your workflow and ensures that your data ends up in the right place.</li>
</ol>
<p>Businesses that rely on QGIS love how these new features provide a seamless way to view and share results, ultimately allowing them to move more quickly and stay in sync:</p>
<p><em><a href="https://felt.com/blog/engineering-client-feedback-felt-qgis-plugin">&#8220;Felt helps us keep each other updated on what we&#8217;ve done, what we&#8217;ve modeled, how things are progressing.&#8221; &#8211; ICON Engineering</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Why is this Update Important?</strong></p>
<p>Web maps are invaluable tools for sharing data with a wider audience, be it colleagues, clients, or the public. They provide creators with the ability to control data visibility, display options, and audience access, all within an easily shareable digital format. However, creating web maps can be an arduous and complex task.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the &#8216;Add to Felt&#8217; QGIS Plugin update comes to the rescue:</p>
<p><strong>1. Streamlining the Process:</strong> Creating web maps traditionally involves website development, data hosting, and map application development—tasks that require a diverse skill set. This complexity can be a significant barrier, especially for smaller operations with limited resources or budget constraints.</p>
<p><strong>2. Felt Simplifies Web Mapping:</strong> Felt makes it effortless to create web maps, and share them as easily as you would a Google Doc or Sheet. Simply drag and drop your data, customize the symbology to your liking, and share the map with a link or by inviting collaborators. No need to send large data files or answer questions about the map&#8217;s data sources.</p>
<p><strong>3. Integration with QGIS:</strong> Now, the &#8216;Add to Felt&#8217; QGIS Plugin bridges the gap between QGIS and Felt. It seamlessly imports your QGIS data into Felt, eliminating the need for manual data transfers and reducing the complexity of web map creation.</p>
<p>In essence, the &#8216;Add to Felt&#8217; QGIS Plugin update simplifies the process of sharing and collaborating on web maps. It empowers users to harness the full potential of web-based mapping, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise. The update makes it even easier to share progress updates or model re-run outputs without creating a new map, or sharing a new map link.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re a QGIS user looking to enhance your map-sharing capabilities and streamline your workflow, make sure to take advantage of this fantastic update. Say goodbye to the complexities of web map creation and hello to effortless, data-rich web maps with Felt and the &#8216;Add to Felt&#8217; QGIS Plugin.</p>
