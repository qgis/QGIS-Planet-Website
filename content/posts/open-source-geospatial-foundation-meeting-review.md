This is an unofficial recap of the OSGF meeting, based on my recollections having spent 10 hours on IRC and the phone. I&rsquo;m sure the foundation will release an official version of the day&rsquo;s events, so take my comments with a grain of salt.
As I stated in an earlier post, the name was chosen early on and without an excessive amount of debate. OSGF rolls off the tongue rather easily and has a nice ring to it.
