Another great QGIS hackfest is gone, and it&#8217;s time for a quick report.

The location was the Linux Hotel, one of the best places where open source developers could meet, friendly, geek-oriented and when the weather is good, like this time, villa Vogelsang is a wonderful place to have a beer in the garden while talking about software development or life in general.

This is a short list of what kept me busy during the hackfest:
<ul>
 	<li>fixed some bugs and feature requests on the official QGIS plugin repo that I&#8217;m maintaining since the very beginning</li>
 	<li>make the QGIS official plugin repository website mobile-friendly</li>
 	<li>QGIS Server Python Plugin API refactoring, I&#8217;ve completed the work on the new API, thanks to the ongoing server refactoring it&#8217;s now much cleaner than it was in the first version</li>
 	<li>attribute table bugs: I started to address some nasty bugs in the attribute table, some of those were fixed during the week right after the hackfest</li>
 	<li>unified add layer button, we had a productive meeting where we decided the path forward to implement this feature, thanks to Boundless that is funding the development, this feature is what&#8217;s I&#8217;m currently working on these days</li>
</ul>
Thanks to all QGIS donors and funders that made yet another great hackfest possible and in particular to Boundless Spatial Inc. for funding my personal expenses.
