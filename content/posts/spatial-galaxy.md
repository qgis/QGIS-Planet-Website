This site aims to bring out some of the latest and sometimes not-so-greatest happenings in the GIS world. We&rsquo;ll focus to large extent on Open Source software but hopefully mix it up to keep things interesting. We&rsquo;ll explore things from the new and exciting to the dull and mundane.
There are a lot of GIS/Spatial sites out there. Hopefully we can provide some content of interest and you will add this one to those you visit frequently.
