Lets face it, GIS systems are complicated. Typically there are multiple servers and applications that make up a &ldquo;system&rdquo;. Each of these represent a potential point of failure, thus creating a brittle system. Brittle systems break. The definition of the word brittle is:
Brittle: Solid, but liable to break or shatter
In other words, we can design solid systems that serve us well, but they can be brittle. We can push on them a bit and they perform well, but push too hard and the whole thing shatters.
