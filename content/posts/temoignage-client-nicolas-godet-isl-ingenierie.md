<p>A hydraulic engineer by training, Nicolas Godet has been working at ISL Ingénierie for just over seven years and holds the position of hydraulic project manager (flood risk, hydraulic structure safety), deputy director of the Saint-Jean-de-Luz facility, and QGIS (and GIS in general) advisor.</p>
<p>He discusses the implementation of QDT and the associated methodology for deploying QGIS across ISL’s IT infrastructure.</p>
<h2>What are the objectives of the collaboration?</h2>
<p>Before I took charge of deploying QGIS at ISL, it was a bit of a mess: no one had the same version, the same plugins, or the same practices.<br/>
Following the switch to QGIS3, there was a desire to standardize the QGIS fleet at ISL to have the same version, the same plugin base, and preconfigured profiles.</p>
<p>An initial, semi-homemade solution was implemented in 2022, but it proved difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>At the end of 2024, with a budget allocated, we decided to seek assistance from Oslandia to professionalize our QGIS deployment so that every employee would be using the same version:</p>
<ul>
<li>facilitate project sharing within ISL and with our clients,</li>
<li>have a common and up-to-date plugin base,</li>
<li>benefit from advanced pre-configuration of user profiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate goal was to be able to update QGIS without disrupting all the configurations.</p>
<h2>What challenges does this project address?</h2>
<p>The challenge was to be able to keep up with developments in QGIS while retaining profile configurations. Having attended a few presentations (QGIS Days), I had heard about <a href="https://qgis-deployment.github.io/qgis-deployment-toolbelt-cli/">QDT</a>. After preliminary discussions with Oslandia (and in particular with Julien Moura), we agreed to go ahead with customized training. This customized training allowed us to adapt the content to our needs.</p>
<h2>How did the collaboration with Oslandia go?</h2>
<p>The Oslandia teams are attentive, adapt to our needs, which are not always simple, and were able to offer us tailor-made training.</p>
<p>We decided to have four half-days spread out over several weeks, allowing us to cover the theory and a few examples during the half-day, then work on our own and come back to the next session with questions and ask for more in-depth coverage of certain points rather than others.<br/>
There’s not much else to add except that it went very well!</p>
<p>Since this training, ISL has been able to invest in QDT.</p>
