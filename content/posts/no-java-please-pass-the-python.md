After a rather long lapse, I had the occasion to write some Java code recently (mainly because it didn&rsquo;t look like Howard&rsquo;s PySDE was functional).
I didn&rsquo;t like it.
Not to start a language flame war, but after using Python almost exclusively for 6 months, I found Java to be cumbersome. I kept thinking &ldquo;if it were Python I could do it this way&rdquo;.
Sending an email from Java&ndash;frightening. From Python&ndash;simple.
