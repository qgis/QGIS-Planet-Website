This week we highlight the Points to Paths plugin, a handy way to convert a series of points into line features. This plugin lets you &ldquo;connect the dots&rdquo; based on an common attribute and a sequence field. The attribute field determines which points should be grouped together into a line. The sequence field determines the order in which the points will connected. The output from this plugin is a shapefile.
