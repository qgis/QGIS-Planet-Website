Last week I&#8217;ve been in Madeira at the hackfest, like all the past events this has been an amazing happening,
for those of you who have never been there, a QGIS hackfest is typically an event where QGIS developers
and other pasionate contributors like documentation writers, translators etc. gather together to discuss
the future of their beloved QGIS software.

QGIS hackfest are informal events where meetings are scheduled freely and any topic relevant to the project
can be discussed.

This time we have brought to the table some interesting topics like:
<ul>
 	<li>the future of processing providers: should they be part of QGIS code or handled independently as plugins?</li>
 	<li>the road forward to a better bug reporting system and CI platform: move to gitlab?</li>
 	<li>the certification program for QGIS training courses: how (and how much) training companies should give back to the project?</li>
 	<li>SWOT analysis of current QGIS project: very interesting discussion about the status of the project.</li>
 	<li>QGIS Qt Quick modules for mobile QGIS app</li>
</ul>
Tehre were also some mentoring sessions where I presented:
<ul>
 	<li>How to set up a development environment and make your first pull request</li>
 	<li>How to write tests for QGIS (in both python and C++)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

At this link you can find all the video recordings of the sessions:

Here is a link to the Vagrant QGIS developer VM I&#8217;ve prepared for the session:

I&#8217;ve got a good feedback from other devs about my sessions and I&#8217;m really happy
that somebody found them useful, one of the main goals of a QGIS hackfest should
really be to help other developers to ramp up quicly into the project.

Other than that, I&#8217;ve also find the time to update to QGIS 3.0 some
of my old plugins like GeoCoding and QuickWKT.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.naturalgis.pt/">Giovanni Manghi</a> and to Madeira Government for the organizazion and thanks to all QGIS sponsors and donors!
