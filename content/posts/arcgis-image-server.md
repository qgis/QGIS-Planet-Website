I was interested to read that ArcGIS Image Server is now available. Now I admit that I haven&rsquo;t had any advanced information about the product (has anybody?) but was disappointed to find that its only supported on Windows servers.
Disappointed but not surprised. I was hoping for a more open API (specifically something other than ArcObjects and/or .Net) and the ability to use image server on Linux/Unix.
