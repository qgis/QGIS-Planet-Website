<p>We’re genuinely excited to co-organise the upcoming <strong>QGIS User Conference</strong> together with <strong>QGIS User Group Switzerland</strong>, and to do so in <strong>Laax</strong>, right here in the Swiss Alps.</p>
<p>Laax is home to <strong>OPENGIS.ch</strong> and the place where <strong>QField</strong> was born. It is a setting that has shaped how we work, how we collaborate, and how we think about building open-source tools that are meant to be used in the real world.</p>

<p>Bringing the global QGIS community together in such a place feels just right. People and ideas come together around open source, with space to exchange, reflect, and collaborate, in an environment that mirrors values that are deeply rooted in our DNA and our close connection to nature.</p>

<li>And yes, there will be plenty of opportunities to hike, bike, fly, or simply enjoy great conversations <img alt="🚵‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" src="/img/subscribers/opengisch/qgis-user-conference-2026-welcoming-the-community-to-laax/1f6b5-200d-2640-fe0f.webp" style="height: 1em;"/><img alt="🪂" class="wp-smiley" src="/img/subscribers/opengisch/qgis-user-conference-2026-welcoming-the-community-to-laax/1fa82.webp" style="height: 1em;"/><img alt="🚶‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" src="/img/subscribers/opengisch/qgis-user-conference-2026-welcoming-the-community-to-laax/1f6b6-200d-2642-fe0f.webp" style="height: 1em;"/></li>
</ul>
<p>The mountains will not just be a backdrop. They will be part of the conference experience.</p>
<p>As Marco, our CEO and Chair of QGIS.org, puts it:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“I’ve never been more excited about a QGIS conference location announcement. Welcoming the community to my hometown in the Swiss Alps feels very special. This is where OPENGIS.ch is based and where QField was born, and it is a perfect place for meaningful exchanges and shared experiences.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re very much looking forward to organising this conference and to welcoming the QGIS community to Laax for what we hope will be a memorable and inspiring QGIS User Conference.</p>
