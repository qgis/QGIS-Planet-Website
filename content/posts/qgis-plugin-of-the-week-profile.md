This week we take a look at a how to plot a terrain profile using the Profile plugin. The plugin can be used with any raster format supported by QGIS. You can can display profiles from up to three rasters at once, allowing you to compare the results. To illustrate, we&rsquo;ll create a simple profile using a DEM of a 1:63,360 quadrangle in Alaska.
Installing the Plugin The Profile plugin is installed like all other Python plugins.
