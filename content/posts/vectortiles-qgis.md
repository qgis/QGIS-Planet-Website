<p>We are happy to announce a new crowdfunding campaign to <a href="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/vectortile-qgis/">support Vector Tiles in QGIS</a>!</p>

<p>This will be a great step for QGIS to support an increasingly popular technology used in web mapping to deliver
maps that are faster and more flexible at the same time.</p>

<p>With native support for Vector Tiles in QGIS, you will be able to add more resources to your QGIS map:</p>

<!-- more -->

<ul>
  <li>Support for remote resources (e.g. HTTP/HTTPS map tiles)</li>
  <li>Handling local vector tiles (in XYZ format)</li>
  <li>Handling database vector tiles (Mapbox Vector Tiles format)</li>
</ul>

<p>The target amount is 8,000 € and the campaign will be active until 20 March 2020.</p>

<p>Please have a look at the dedicated page <a href="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/vectortile-qgis/">Vector Tiles support in QGIS</a> for further details and help us spread the word!</p>
